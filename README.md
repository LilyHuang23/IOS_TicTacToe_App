# IOS_TicTacToe_App
# Overview


I have always been interested in creating a game app by myself because I am a big fan of some cooking games. I am also a big fan of the iOS system and wanted
to learn more about it for a long time. I hope to use this very first experience to give me a little bit guide and thought to build my own 
game in the future. This is a Tic Tac Toe game. Since I have learned multiple times how to design the Tic Tac Toe algorithm in school so I think
it would be a good idea to use it on this project. This is player vs AI and the rule is very simple, who gets a line then wins the game. When one 
player crosses a line, the user can decide whether start the next game or review the board. If you want to start the new game, click reset. 
Or if you want to review the board, click cancel.

# Development Environment

I am using Xcode and Swift for this project. I have never touch this language before and I am glad this works out great. I also 
learned how to create my first GitHub token in order to publish this project to the GitHub. I didn't use any library at this point 
but I think Swift has a lot of defult function and some of them are very cool!
